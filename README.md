Hi! I am Lucas from Spain. Aspiring self-taught software developer.

I like programming, reading productivity-finance books and playing videogames.

You will find most of my projects that I make in my free time here!

Iâ€™m currently learning Full stack development in Freecodecamp and working on my personal webpage.
